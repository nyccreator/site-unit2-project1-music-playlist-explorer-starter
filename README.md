### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes. Learning about Javascript was a huge help in implementing the features. Variables, functions, event listeners and manipulating the DOM all played a role in dynamically displaying playlists on the web page. Although some of the main features were difficult to figure out, it was possible with the information we were taught and research. I would have liked to learn about forms and some common functions for manipulating strings and arrays in lecture. I had to do a good bit of research when trying to implement adding a playlist, editing a playlist, sorting, and searching.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time, I would have made my website responsive. The layout works for my viewport size, but becomes disorganized as the viewport becomes smaller. The way I ended up displaying the modal for each playlist is not the most efficient or clear. I would have also liked to add the ability to edit playlists. I began to work on the ability to edit a playlist by creating the button, but ran out of time to implement it fully.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I was able to introduce the project and give an overview of what the website does. I explained all of the main features and stretch features that I implemented. I also went into my favorite feature, the sorting and searching, and my most challenging feature, the modal. Something to work on is the length of my presentation. I used a little over half of the required time. Next time I should go through my website in more detail and speak on my development experience to fill out the time.
